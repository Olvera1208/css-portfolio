          Hi my name is Isiah Olvera i was born at Esihnhower Hospital in rancho mirage, Califonia on December 08,1998. I grew up playing sports my whole childhood. Played a variety of sports football,soccer,basketball,and baseball. My favorite was Basketball.I also grew up playing video games which i love till this day. I was only allowed to play on weekends cause I would stay up all night on school nights if i had the chance. Man I couldn't wait to go home on fridays and just sit their and play all day and night. I  never really thought about life after school like College or getting a job. I was always so busy with sports and games i just never thought about the day would come when it was all over.
       <br><br>
       high school for me was fun met new people even made some friends. I played football all 4 years and played basketball 2 years of the 4. Football for me was fun I loved playing in those friday night lights I couldnt wait to go out their and play. I didn't think 4 years could go so fast but i did it came time to figure out what i was gonna do. I started collge after high school and would attend Collge of the Desert. I went to College for about 2 years. Found out it wasn't for me but I knew I had to find a carrer. I got my first job at larwence welk resort i was their about 2 years before I left. I bounced job to job after that even worked 2 jobs at once. After about 3 years i decided i wanted a career so i found this codiing bootcamp which has been difficult at times but is fun. Learning all these skills i never learned for me was challanging for me.
